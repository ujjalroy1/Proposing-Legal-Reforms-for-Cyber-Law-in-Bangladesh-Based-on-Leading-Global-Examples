# Building a Resilient Digital Future: Proposing Legal Reforms for Cyber Law in Bangladesh Based on Leading Global Examples



## 1. Introduction

1.1 Background

As Bangladesh rapidly transitions into a digital society, the risks of cyber threats, data breaches, and digital rights violations have also increased. While initiatives like "Digital Bangladesh" have enhanced connectivity and digital literacy, the cyber legal framework remains outdated, vague, and often repressive in its implementation. Effective cyber laws are essential to ensure digital safety, economic resilience, and the protection of human rights.

1.2 Problem Statement

Although Bangladesh has enacted cyber laws such as the Information and Communication Technology Act (2006), Digital Security Act (2018), and the recently passed Cyber Security Act (2023), they have faced criticism for vague language, inadequate protection of digital rights, and misuse for suppressing dissent [1]. These limitations hinder the country's ability to combat cybercrime effectively while maintaining democratic principles.

1.3 Objectives

To critically assess the current cyber laws in Bangladesh.

To examine successful global models in cyber legislation.

To propose reform strategies that align with both global standards and local needs.
## 2. Literature Review

2.1 Cyber Law Framework in Bangladesh

The Digital Security Act, 2018 was enacted to replace parts of the ICT Act. However, its ambiguous provisions and lack of safeguards for freedom of expression led to international and domestic criticism [1]. The Cyber Security Act, 2023 attempted to amend these issues but still retained problematic aspects, such as criminalizing vague offenses like "hurting religious sentiments" online [2].

2.2 Draft Cyber Protection Ordinance, 2024

In December 2024, the government introduced the Draft Cyber Protection Ordinance, intended to further refine cyber regulation. Legal experts and civil rights activists raised concerns regarding its limited stakeholder involvement and lack of clarity on key provisions [3].


## 3. Global Best Practices in Cyber Law

3.1 European Union: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The GDPR is a globally recognized standard that enforces data subject rights, data breach notifications, and transparency in data processing. It provides a rights-based approach to digital governance [4].

3.2 United States: Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA)

CISA encourages the voluntary sharing of cyber threat information between government agencies and the private sector to build a collective defense mechanism [5].

3.3 Japan: Active Cyber Defence Law

Japan passed this law in 2025 to allow government agencies to actively engage in defensive cyber operations. It reflects a shift from passive cybersecurity to proactive threat mitigation [6].

3.4 Australia: Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2024

Australia adopted sweeping privacy reforms that enhance individual rights and impose heavy penalties for data breaches, aiming to align with EU GDPR principles [7].


## 4. Proposed Reforms for Bangladesh

4.1 Enact a Comprehensive Data Protection Law

Inspired by GDPR, Bangladesh should introduce a dedicated data protection act that upholds data subject rights, mandates breach notifications, and establishes an independent data protection authority.

4.2 Refine Legal Language

Remove vague and broad terminologies from existing laws. Clearly define cyber offenses, investigatory powers, and judicial processes to avoid misuse.

4.3 Institutional Capacity Building

Develop specialized cybercrime units with proper training in digital forensics, threat detection, and legal compliance.

4.4 Multi-Stakeholder Policy Making

Ensure that legal reforms involve consultation with civil society, private sector, academia, and international experts to ensure balanced and inclusive policies.

4.5 International Collaboration

Engage with global institutions such as the ITU, INTERPOL, and APNIC for technical support, knowledge sharing, and threat intelligence.


## 5. Methodology

5.1 Doctrinal Legal Research

This research will involve doctrinal analysis of current and proposed Bangladeshi cyber laws and global statutes like the GDPR, CISA, and ACD laws.

5.2 Comparative Legal Analysis

A comparative approach will identify gaps and strengths by aligning Bangladeshi laws with international norms.

5.3 Stakeholder Interviews (Proposed)

Subject to approval, interviews with legal scholars, law enforcement officials, and cyber security experts will be conducted to validate practical challenges and reform viability.
